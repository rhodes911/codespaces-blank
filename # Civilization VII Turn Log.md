# 🧠 Civilization VII Turn Logger & Machine Learning Trainer

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Goal**: Create a plugin-based system to log detailed Civilization VII gameplay data in order to train machine learning models capable of learning and recommending optimal strategies for beating the game. The long-term vision is to build an AI assistant or self-play engine that can outperform even the most advanced human players in various victory types (science, culture, domination, etc).

This project will:
- **Collect structured turn-by-turn gameplay data**
- **Log metadata, decisions, and results** of Civ 7 games
- **Aggregate data across players** in a standardized format
- **Train predictive and prescriptive AI models**
- Eventually support **autonomous strategy discovery** through self-play and reinforcement learning

---

## 📊 Why This Matters

Civilization is a deep, turn-based strategy game where each decision can ripple across 200+ turns. It’s ideal for research in:
- **Sequential decision-making**
- **Game theory**
- **Long-term strategy optimization**
- **Reinforcement learning**

By logging enough high-quality data from real player games, we can train an AI to:
- Predict likely outcomes from a current game state
- Recommend optimal next actions
- Simulate full-game strategy trees
- Discover new paths to victory across different civilizations and maps

## 🕹️ What the System Will Do

### ✅ Phase 1: Human Logging System

- Use a Markdown-based format to log each game and turn.
- Allow players to input their decisions manually for now.
- Collect:
  - Resources: Science, Culture, Faith, Gold
  - Cities and Districts
  - Military Strength
  - Government, Policies
  - Technology/Civics chosen
  - Wonders built
  - War declarations and diplomatic actions
  - Victory path and outcome

### 🧠 Example Metadata for One Game

```yaml
game_id: game-001
player_civ: "Egypt"
difficulty: "Emperor"
map_type: "Continents"
map_size: "Standard"
victory_type_pursued: "Science"
victory_achieved: "TBD"
turns: TBD
notes: "Testing logging system with a classical science rush."

📅 Example Per-Turn Entry

turn: 41
era: "Classical"
science: 28.4
culture: 20.1
gold: 310
faith: 90
military_strength: 330
cities: 3
districts: ["Campus", "Holy Site"]
tech_researched: "Construction"
civic_chosen: "Political Philosophy"
wonders_built: ["Pyramids"]
wars_declared: ["Greece"]
notes: "Preparing for expansion south after stabilizing science production."

🧱 How It Works

1. Markdown-Based Turn Logs
	•	Human-readable .md files for each game
	•	Stored under /games/ folder with unique IDs
	•	Each game has full metadata + sequential turn data
	•	Easy to diff, commit, share, and version

2. Optional Future Automation

Once Civ 7 modding or telemetry is available:
	•	Use memory reading or APIs to capture game state
	•	Implement OCR overlay tools to detect screen elements (e.g., Tesseract + OpenCV)
	•	Hook into Next Turn hotkey to auto-log data

3. Data Extraction & Storage
	•	Write a Python parser to convert markdown logs to JSON or CSV
	•	Store in SQLite locally or Supabase/PostgreSQL for scalability
	•	Include scripts to validate schema and normalize entries

⸻

🧠 What We’ll Use the Data For

📈 1. Statistical Analysis
	•	Win rates per civ / map type / strategy
	•	Early-game choices correlated with victory
	•	Analysis of common loss patterns
	•	Identify dominant player paths

🤖 2. ML & AI Models

Supervised Learning
	•	Predict outcome (victory type or loss) based on early game state
	•	Recommend next actions based on historical performance

Example Models:
	•	Logistic regression to classify game outcome likelihood
	•	Decision trees to map victory conditions to strategy sequences
	•	Neural networks to model high-dimensional turn data

Reinforcement Learning (Phase 3+)
	•	Define rewards (e.g., tech progress, unit success, win)
	•	Train AI agents to make turn-based decisions
	•	Use player logs as expert demonstrations (imitation learning)
	•	Explore self-play and simulation environments

🧪 Example Training Scenario

Input: Game state at Turn 60
- 4 cities
- Campus and Commercial Hub built
- Tech: Education
- Culture: 28.4
- Military: 170
- Pursuing Science Victory

Model Output:
- 76% chance of Science Victory
- Suggested actions: Prioritize Industrial Zones, build Universities
- Avoid war unless defensive


⸻

🔌 Optional Plugin Features (Stretch Goals)

If Civ 7 modding tools or APIs become available:
	•	Build a UI overlay plugin that hooks into game events
	•	Enable real-time stat logging
	•	Support multiple player telemetry
	•	Allow live game analysis dashboards

🔐 Ethics & Privacy

This project prioritizes privacy and transparency:
	•	All logs are user-owned
	•	No personal data is ever collected
	•	Multiplayer logs (if ever used) will be fully anonymized
	•	Contributors can opt-in to share logs for open AI research

⸻

🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions from:
	•	Civ players logging games
	•	Python devs writing parsers or scripts
	•	Data scientists building models

🚀 The Long-Term Vision

Imagine an AI that:
	•	Knows how to beat Civilization VII on Deity
	•	Learns not from hardcoded rules, but from thousands of human games
	•	Adapts to your playstyle and improves your win rate
	•	Becomes a digital grandmaster in 4X strategy

This is more than a mod. It’s a step toward machine understanding of strategic long-term planning — and a way to make your next game a little smarter.

Let’s build it. One turn at a time.

Would you like me to generate:
- A `turn-log-template.md` file to go with this?
- A JSON schema for validating logs?
- A sample `game-001.md` file to demonstrate usage?

Let me know how you'd like to expand the repo next.
